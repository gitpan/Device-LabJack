The patch folder contains a patch for the labjack.c file.  The patch
replaces the usb_unlink_urb calls with usb_kill_urb.  This takes care 
of the "Badness in usb_unlink_urb" message seen when running dmesg.  
You only need to use the patch with kernels 2.6.10 and above.

Patching Instructions 
  
From the patch folder, run the following command:
	
	# patch -p0 <labjack_urb_kill.patch

The labjack.c file should be patched now.  To install the patched 
device driver, follow the instructions in the ../../INSTALL file for
2.6 kernel users.
